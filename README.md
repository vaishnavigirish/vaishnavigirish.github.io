# Vaishnavi Girish – Electrical Engineering Portfolio

I am an Electrical Engineering student at New York University, with a minor in Finance (Aug 2024 – Expected May 2028), and dedicated to building secure, intelligent, and high-performance systems. My work bridges embedded hardware, circuit design, applied machine learning, and digital manufacturing cybersecurity; experience gained through research, technical teaching, and engineering internships.

I develop solutions that operate at the intersection of hardware, software, and data: assistive devices powered by microcontrollers, AI-driven defect detection pipelines that strengthen energy infrastructure, and encrypted CAD workflows that protect the integrity of additive manufacturing. My finance background strengthens my ability to evaluate engineering decisions through the lens of scalability, risk, and long-term systems impact.

Across every project, I focus on engineering systems that are precise, reliable, and robust under real-world conditions. Driven by curiosity, technical depth, and a commitment to impactful problem-solving, I thrive in environments where innovation and engineering discipline come together to advance the technologies shaping our future.
