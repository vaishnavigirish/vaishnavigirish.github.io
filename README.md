## 🔥 Highlighted Projects

### Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Assistant – NYU Tandon School of Engineering  
*Aug 2025 – Present | Brooklyn, NY*  
As an Engineering Undergraduate TA in the Rapid Assembly and Design (RAD) environment, I play a key role in supporting the training and technical growth of first-year engineering students. My work combines instructional guidance, hands-on prototyping support, and engineering problem-solving across hardware and software domains.

I mentor students in foundational engineering practices including: CAD modeling, 3D printing, soldering, breadboarding, Arduino programming, circuitry, and rapid prototyping. I support them through the entire design cycle—from conceptualization and feasibility to hardware integration and testing. I also help maintain and troubleshoot prototyping equipment including soldering stations, 3D printers, microcontroller kits, and electronics benches, ensuring reliable lab operations.

My work includes:  
- Teaching students how to design, fabricate, and test early-stage prototypes using CAD and 3D printing workflows.  
- Guiding debugging of embedded systems, including faulty wiring, sensor errors, voltage mismatches, thermal issues, and code logic failures.  
- Delivering lab sessions alongside faculty to introduce engineering fundamentals through hands-on tasks.  
- Preparing students for more advanced courses by building strong technical and problem-solving foundations.

### AI-Based Fusion Joint Defect Detection – Mears Group LLC  
*Software Engineering Intern | June 2025 – Aug 2025 | Houston, TX*  
I worked on a computer vision–based AI pipeline used to detect structural defects and leaks in natural gas pipeline fusion joints. This work contributes to improving public safety and infrastructure reliability in the energy sector.

I designed Python preprocessing and postprocessing workflows that standardized and improved the dataset used for classification. This included image normalization, bounding-box alignment, shape filtering, contrast correction, noise reduction, and geometric consistency checks to ensure the model received high-quality inputs. I also built post-inference utilities for smoothing predictions, filtering outliers, and visualizing defect regions.

The system achieved **82% accuracy** during pilot testing after incorporating these enhancements.

Key contributions include:  
- Automated dataset preparation through Python scripts that improved reliability and reduced manual labor.  
- Improved model performance by refining image preprocessing pipelines and artifact reduction steps.  
- Built visualization tools that enabled engineers to inspect prediction confidence and misclassified cases.  
- Worked with engineers to prepare the model for operational deployment in field inspections.

### Digital Manufacturing Cybersecurity – Hack3D VIP (NYU)  
*Jan 2025 – Present | Brooklyn, NY*  
As part of the Hack3D Digital Manufacturing Cybersecurity VIP team, I investigate how to secure additive manufacturing pipelines against cyber-physical attacks. Cyberattacks on 3D printers can change internal geometries, weaken structures, or leak proprietary designs, making this a critical research area for both industry and national security.

I develop methods to detect, prevent, and analyze tampering in CAD and STL files using a multi-layered approach that combines cryptographic reinforcement, machine learning, file-level anomaly detection, and physics-based simulation.

My work includes:  
- Securing CAD and STL files using encryption, digital watermarking, steganography, and signature-based verification.  
- Training ML models that detect malicious geometry edits, irregular mesh features, or compromised slicer outputs.  
- Using FEM (Finite Element Modeling) simulations to evaluate how subtle geometry changes influence stress distribution and structural failure.  
- Employing MicroCT scanning and internal imaging to identify deviations between intended and printed parts in cyberattack scenarios.  
- Evaluating risks associated with file interception, printer firmware manipulation, and digital twin exploitation.

This project strengthens the security and trustworthiness of future digital manufacturing systems.

### EchoLink – Assistive Communication Device for Non-Verbal Patients  
*Jan 2025 – May 2025 | NYU Tandon*  
EchoLink is a Bluetooth-enabled assistive communication device designed for non-verbal patients who need a low-cost, portable method to express basic needs. It uses tactile input and an LCD interface to send pre-programmed messages to a caregiver’s device.

I engineered the entire system architecture, including embedded logic, circuit design, board-level wiring, and hardware prototyping.

The device integrates:  
- **Arduino microcontroller** for control logic  
- **Bluetooth (BLE) module** for wireless communication  
- **LCD display** for message selection  
- **Tactile buttons** for user input  
- **Custom-soldered circuitry** for power distribution and signal integrity  

I developed the C-based embedded program that cycles through message menus, transmits user selections over BLE, and handles UI logic. I designed and soldered the circuit, debugging issues related to debounce timing, voltage drop, and serial interference. I also modeled an ergonomic enclosure using CAD tools to improve usability.

EchoLink demonstrates how embedded systems can support accessible healthcare technologies.
